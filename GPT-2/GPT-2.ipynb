    "# Introduction\n",
    "This is the training phase of GPT-2. Elaborated in our report and presentation, we have decided to train on both general and food models. \n",
    "###  Setup\n",
    "1. Ensure that gpt-2-simple package is installed and you have sufficient RAM and GPU to train the large model\n",
    "2. Make sure that dataset is in same folder\n",
    "3. This was trained in Colab with GPU and High RAM (30GB RAM) and Google Cloud Platform (1x P100 GPU and 15GB n1-standard-4 CPUs)\n",
    "4. Ensure you have at least 10 GB of harddisk space\n",
    "\n",

    "# Summary of Findings:\n",
    "1. GPT-2 Large is able to generate complex sentences consistently even though it is only trained on 5000 epochs\n",
    "2. It takes about 45 secs to generate 3 samples with a length of 10 from a Large model\n",
    "3. For the text generated to be of better quality, it is recommended to provide more context rather than giving a general input like \"I like the\""

      " pretty little sweet for a salad dish, but it still tastes absolutely amazing after my 1/2-hour soak in my glass of water. I enjoyed the roasted barley with walnut vinaigrette and some grilled onion straws a little to my surprise. The service was also amazing. Great customer service. Definitely a great place to come and have a good meal. I will definitely be back and have to try some other food from the menu again on the regular or at one of my upcoming appointments.<|endoftext|>\n",

      "It was at about 9pm on Thursday around 6pm. The whole staff were walking around and asking if you had any issues and that you were the most important person, and to their surprise they would ask how many times you had asked the waiter how many times, how long it took to get here, how bad you were...\n",
      "\n",
      "I got 3 different sushi plates and ordered 2-3 of the most popular things the restaurant asked me to do on the sushi. One of my favorites was the roll that was the most expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Tama (rice) roll and it was just like a standard roll. The rice was soft and fluffy and the sushi was fresh. Not dry at all. I could feel my sushi getting sipped and was able to enjoy it as much as I wanted without leaving a big hole. Everything was very fresh and also very tasty.\n",
      "\n",

      "There's a reason this place gets 5 stars. It's because of the amazing staff.

What an adventure. We got our wings with buffalo and I swear I felt I was going to cry. They were delicious, spicy yet not too mush when served.

If they can't be there when you want them to be there, then don't ask. I was already in the dining room when they offered these fish tacos. They were the best tacos ever. The shrimp were tender, meaty and not overly salty.  I don't want to say that the pork didn't come out of the oven with the spicy sauce but I did, and wow! I had the taco that was stuffed with pepitas. It had a delicious kick, really good. It had a nice kick to it and had pepitas on top.  The other was the beef tacos. These were flavorful, seasoned and were light but had good portions.  The only thing I didn't care for was the rice on the bottom. If you like rice, you probably need to add it. The potato and the chicken, rice is also very chewy and a little spongy.  So maybe they did it but you will go in hungry anyway.\n",

I checked Amazon for deals around Halloween, but she had the cheapest deals in their area (this was good since she could take her time with her clients), and that the prices were slightly better than any other nearby place.

In the main lobby you are greeted by a smiling manager, who is also friendly.  They use very clean products and are very nice and helpful.  The front room is where you need to pay for your services and most of the people I've encountered are very nice.

The only disappointment was a time that it took us a while to arrive, but it was worth it. We were told it would be just fine, so we were able to just make it! We were there a few minutes after checkin, and it was so quiet! Not a bad thing as we were there to watch the show, but it was also the perfect spot to sit for a bit.

The calamari is super soft and juicy, and the sweet sauce is awesome\n",

I've been to many places in my aunt's office and at these offices, it's beautiful, but not exactly like your aunt has described to me. Here, they aren't just pictures, they say everything the walls and floors are covered in. The walls are beautiful. The floors are always covered with the carpet and the floors are well insulated. The room itself is huge. It feels like a warehouse in your aunt's office, complete with all kinds of different offices and offices, offices that are completely off in the distance from each other, and of course a lobby which was just incredible.

He was very honest on what had happened and advised me to come in and have the car examined.  I did exactly what I needed to do and the service guy took her time looking to know exactly what the issue was.   The Honda was running perfectly when I picked it on the way to work but when I picked it up the day the appointment, my transmission and brakes started to go flat out.  A couple of days after the car, my Honda started running in the same way as it had when the shop dropped off Honda.  It was a flat out, not a stalled out, in the rain.  The maintenance guy said the car stalled out, but that he had no idea what had happened.  He said he had no knowledge of what had happened but he could have checked the car himself.

She explained things to me that I could not have done myself.  I told her I had a big issue with my Honda, but I wanted her to run a very thorough diagnostic on some more important questions.  She didn't try to run tests on the other parts since she knew the issue, and she explained why she ran those tests in the first place.  She gave me a full tune up on my entire car, and then it was time to do the tune up.  She took the time to spend a couple minutes on the radio talking to the crew that had worked on the car when they dropped off it that day.  She told them about my car, and they showed her the problem when it was first placed back in the shop.    They fixed a loose tire that no one could figure out on their first guess.  She gave me a discount on the repair.  They explained that they would have to change the tire out, but they could have the repair done in about an hour.  After he fixed the tire, the service manager came out to see if the tire was a \"regular tire.  I told them that my Honda was a $300 and it would be about $400.  They said that it would be about two days to get it back out, but they could have it back out by 2 a week.  One week.  So they said they could have the tire out in that week for a check-up.  That was exactly what she told me.  I brought the car in for a check-up and asked her to drive the tire back in.   I told my mechanic a couple of times what had happened, but he said he'd have to fix it the next two days.   Now, my Honda stopped running at that point.

The chicken wrap was fresh and seasoned for you to choose and it was a big, warm piece of white rice that had a perfect combination of salt and soy. That is because it is really rice, in all the right ways.\n",

      "The only other minor complaint I have is finding out about how often the restaurant will offer free drinks and fried rice, but that's a new problem to me. Because I've been here far too many times.\n",

      "*Update: * 2/26/13: I've tried other dishes off of the \"Big Curry,\" and I have a much different experience from the \"Big Curry\" - I'm actually sorry about it. In the regular Curry bowl, I got just the regular rice and this time a little bit extra for my curry bowl's \"chicken\" sauce. But I still can't complain - so I'm no big deal with my regular bowl.\n",

I never heard of the name, or the food anyway. I always figured it out (luckily I had the most important thing to go, the seafood dinner), but it took me over a few seconds to figure out what to order on my seafood. But there was no wait! I ordered shrimp prawns. Wow wow, wow. The shrimp was a big chunk of thick shrimp meat, cooked just right for me. This also didn't have shrimp in it. It was a huge shrimp and crab mixture, like a mongolian version of shawarma. It was very good, but I'm not sure if it's the real deal, but I was thinking it was delicious. Next I ordered the al pastor. This is my absolute favourite thing there! It is a bit on the heavy/sweet side, and the fried rice was ok, but I like rice a bit more.  And I love fried rice! There are a bunch of different sauces at this place, but I personally didn't taste one I didn't want to put in it! I was really excited to say that there is actually fried rice here, so I ordered it fried anyway. It was fried in a delicious garlic garlic sauce. This one was the best, I actually don't know how they put it in it! My friend ordered salmon. It was perfectly cooked so that the salmon was not soggy at all. I'm not sure what their special sauce was, but I was super excited at the end of eating that. It had salmon in it, which came in a big piece, super light, and it tasted like an omelette, but without the usual garlic sauce. This one was amazing, but there were a few other things that I would have liked to have in it. For me, all those are definitely overrated items, and the poutine is the one I wish that they wouldn't make because I love tuna tuna so much, but if I make an order of albacore tuna I don't think the waiter would know what kind to let you order with. I had a shrimp, but for some reason my friend got a shrimp for her dish. But overall, if I am ever in Vegas, this isn't on the list of must-sesses I want to go.

In fact, I have to make sure I keep this place open so I make sure I make it every day. I love the souffle dishes! I know each souffle is homemade, the service is incredibly attentive and the food is perfect. I have been going there since I was a big fan of the souffle on the menu, probably a couple of years. The souffle is so delicious. The cream of mushroom and cheese, and of course, the cheese and mushroom. You cannot go wrong, and the bread is always just a little dry to me. If you are not a big dough eater, I recommend a side salad of their fresh homemade coleslaw. It has cheese and some great pimentation. It is not overly greasy too. The portion sizes are huge.

It makes sense but that's how it is made and I was concerned that I would have gotten a side of mush (boulew) on the first order I had and the taste I wanted that day. The cheese paste is delicious too! The pita bread is excellent as the bread is so fresh and so delicious. I had an appetizer which I thought was so good I almost ate it all the time, especially when it has cheese. My husband ordered from a typical French place and that was just what we ordered but he left an order, so he had to leave it. I ordered a lamb souffle from a French place and it was amazing. The dressing is wonderful as well and it had a kick that wasn't overpowering. We both get these souffles at once so you're not stuffed.

The poke bowl is a great size and I highly suggest using some soy to fill the poke bowl. I was so happy when we got our poke bowls. It is super crunchy and light after all poke bowls, but it's refreshing how the poke was cooked. This was my first poke bowl and one poke bowl when I have a poke bowl from Poke Bowl again.

      " the dinner.  Never had a problem before at a restaurant before this.  All the reason was this gentleman who served us was working at the kitchen.  He was working there at about 3:00 pm and we had just finished our first half of our lunch and the guy wasn't even working there yet.  This guy literally came in and walked into our booth and started eating.  He was extremely rude to us.  The guy was so rude and took too long to open the door but when we were leaving we pointed out that he just had the wrong door.\n",
      "And I want to clarify that we are talking about the door not being open - yes, he was just being really really rude and he would not let us get up close and walk over to the other end door to wait for that guy to come back so he could actually get to work.  So when he finally opened the door to let us walk over...  he came around the corner with his hand in our booth and did \"chase\" a little, so now we had to stand up.  We were so ready to leave as soon as we see how this guy treated us.  I just want to say that we are from the Midwest and were looking for a good, friendly dining experience.  This guy clearly could not care less about us. \n",

      "<|startoftext|>I've heard much about this place, but somehow I never thought to stop by.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch, he ordered two tacos and a veal bowl, the restaurant was fairly empty.  He got a salad, which was decent.  The waiter served the tacos, which I thought was interesting.  I thought the food was not interesting, and I have never been out at a hot-pot where the manager is absent. I felt that I was a burden to the manager.\n",
      "       The server was polite, at least I was polite.  I can't remember the manager who came by with my order to tell me that my order came with onions.  He came to eat my plate, and he took off before we asked for the manager of this place to apologize for the trouble.\n",
      "     My husband then ordered burritos.  I saw a guy eating there, and asked my husband what they had.  He started by complaining about being under cooked (you can see in my photo, he was clearly still too hungry.  We were in the middle of our meal so if I don't see this gentleman, the reason we did not put a $1 tip on the check is to have it, when he put it there on the other servers plate.  I had a $20 bill, I never tipped him on the rest of the bill even though he should not've tipped. I paid the bill.\n",
      "    We did not tip and were really upset because if you tip 10 on the tab, they will pay it.  The waiter who brought me the bill apologized, and we were both happy with his gesture and his attitude.  I also noticed him on the food and was nice.  At least, he did not take the full plate into my eye after they took the plate.  I'm surprised we would tip 10 on the bill without the full plate.  It wasn't very nice of him.  We left a $20 tip and left to sit down at a good location.\n",
      "         The service was so poor and inattentive.  I don't think their food was bad.  Maybe we weren't hungry, but even our drinks was gross.  They didn't have any of my favorite teas and they had a cup of coffee.  They should be embarrassed that they are getting anything in my money. \n",

While I was eating my dish, I could hear the two young girls at the register calling some more customers that walked in the door, and laughing and calling back. I asked the cashier girl about it and she told me it was nothing and nothing came to mind. After I got an earful of how bad they were, I had enough and called the restaurant. I was given the phone number to reach out to customer service and was given a phone that was full of very rude messages. I was very disappointed with the location's poor customer service.<|endoftext|>\n",

The service, however, was completely lacking. I've never been the only server in the front, and as we were paying, one waitress seemed very confused about the menu, no one checked up on us to make sure our food was ready for our tables to get there. It was also raining and my husband waited till the weather got wet, and that was my fault.\n",

      "The waitress didn't take our order until she dropped off the food. At first we thought this could be a big deal, but after our meal, it seemed to be quite typical of other times we paid. The service, however, was very sloppy, and the food was just ok. \n",
